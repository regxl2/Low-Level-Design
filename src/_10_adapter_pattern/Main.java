package _10_adapter_pattern;

//Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.
//The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects.
//It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object.
//Usage examples: The Adapter pattern is pretty common in Java code.
//Itâ€™s very often used in systems based on some legacy code.
//In such cases, Adapters make legacy code work with modern classes.
